- Neural networks = fit squiggles or bent shapes to data 
- Neural networks consist of *Nodes*, and connection between Nodes, the arrows The numbers along the connections represents paramter valus that were estimatd when this Neural Network was fit to data using a process called *Back-propagation*. The bent or curved lines inside some of the Nodes are called *Activation Functions*, and they make Neural Networks flexible and able to fit just about any data. 
- NN are organized in *Layers*. It has multiple input nodes (input layr), and usually ther are multiple output nodes that form an output layer. The layers in between input and output layers are called *Hidden Layers*.
