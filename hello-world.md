### DAY 1: Histograms, The Main Ideas behind Probability Distributions, The Normal Distribution

- To draw a normal distribution, we need to know:
  1. The avg measurement - tells where the centre of the curve goes
  2. SD of the measurements - tells how wide the curve should be 

### DAY 2: Population and Estimated Parameters

- Normal Distribution Exponential Distribution, Gamma Distribution

- It's very rare to have population data. In statistics, we often estimate the population parameters using samples/some data points. 
- The more data we have, the more confidence we can have in accuracy of the estimates. 
- **p-values** and **confidence intervals** are often used to quantity the confidence in the estimated parameters
